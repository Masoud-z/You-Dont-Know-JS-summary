- primitive values are always assigned/passed as value copies

- In JS, only object values (arrays, objects, functions, etc.) are treated as references.

JS chooses the **value-copy** vs. **reference-copy** behavior based on the value type. **Primitives are held by value**, **objects are held by reference**.

- All functions by default reference an empty object at a property named prototype.
