## Why Global Scope?

In addition to (potentially) accounting for where an applicationâ€™s code resides during runtime, and how each piece is able to access the other pieces to cooperate, the global scope is also where:

- JS exposes its built-ins:
  - primitives: undefined, null, Infinity, NaN
  - natives: Date(), Object(), String(), etc.
  - global functions: eval(), parseInt(), etc.
  - namespaces: Math, Atomics, JSON
  - friends of JS: Intl, WebAssembly
- The environment hosting the JS engine exposes its own built-ins:
  - console (and its methods)
  - the DOM (window, document, etc)
  - timers (setTimeout(..), etc)
  - web platform APIs: navigator, history, geolocation, WebRTC, etc.
